# THIS FORK
This fork gets the code working in Windows. I used VS Code. It took 8 hours to get my VS Code working to run
and debug. I used ucrt64 C++ to compile it. The app opens in a black screen (still need to fix that). Press N
to get a new game started. It's playable but not very stable and there are still many bugs in the code to be
fixed. I was a body guard and the game crashed when I tried to reload my gun.

# Cataclysm 2

A sequel to [Cataclysm](https://github.com/Whales/Cataclysm).
It's a rewrite in many ways.
Please check out my [development blog](http://whalesdev.tumblr.com/) for notes on updates and my techniques.
